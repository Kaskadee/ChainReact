# ChainReact

ChainReact is a simple round-based strategy game 2D Game like Minesweeper.

  - It uses OpenGL so it can be played on linux (currently no offical support)
  - Free and Open Source :)
  - Many ideas will be implemented in feature.

The idea from this game came from a minigame of a german Minecraft server ([Timolia](https://www.timolia.de/ "Timolia"))  
The game is still in development, but you can already play with a partner ;)
